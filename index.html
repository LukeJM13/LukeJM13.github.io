        <p>
          I started at Invdev in March 2023 as an Apprentice Software Developer.
          I knew the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as the bare minimum
          Javascript knowledge. Over the course of my apprenticeship I grew as a
          developer and built-out my list of tools and skills.
          <br />
          My main focus was on gaining an understanding of modern web
          application development, becoming familiar with React and Node.js,
          using Typescript/Javascript as my day-to-day coding language.
          <br />
          Along the way I spent time learning lots of other interesting skills,
          such as GraphQL, Docker, Cypress, Jest and Drupal, as well as the
          developer fundamentals like Git and GitHub.
          <br />
          I even got to work with exciting new technologies; Robotic Process
          Automation tools like UiPath and n8n, as well as low-code solutions
          such as Microsoft Power Platform.

        <p>
          My time at The Electric Car Scheme, despite being quite short, was
          very helpful to my career.
          <br />
          For one thing it taught me that I'm probably not a natural-born
          salesperson and I would find more enjoyment in a career path better
          suited to me and my talents.
          <br />
          It was while working as a Business Development Executive at ECS that I
          decided to pursue a career in software development, which is something
          I'd always considered.
          <br />
          Sometimes it takes working a job that you don't enjoy to push you in
          the right direction. I will always be thankful for everyone at ECS for
          helping me discover my true passion and career path.

          Bulb Energy

        </h4>
        <img id="bulb" src="./images/bulb.jpg" />
        <p>
          I consider my time working at Bulb to be the most important period in
          my life for career, as well as personal growth.
          <br />
          Joining as an Energy Specialist and being tasked with speaking to up
          to 60 customers a day via phones, email and online chat really helped
          me grow in confidence and responsibility.
          <br />
          Spending time in the Social and Community team, conversing with
          customers via social media channels and managing the company app store
          accounts gave me a different perspective on B2C communications .
          <br />
          I also gained so much from my time as acting team leader, having to be
          responsible for a team of people and making sure to give them what
          they needed to help them grow professionally.
