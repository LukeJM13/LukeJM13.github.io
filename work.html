            I started at Invdev in March 2023 as an Apprentice Software
            Developer. I knew the basics of HTML and CSS, as well as the bare
            minimum Javascript knowledge. Over the course of my apprenticeship I
            grew as a developer and built-out my list of tools and skills.
            <br />
            My main focus was on gaining an understanding of modern web
            application development, becoming familiar with React and Node.js,
            using Typescript/Javascript as my day-to-day coding language.
            <br />
            Along the way I spent time learning lots of other interesting
            skills, such as GraphQL, Docker, Cypress, Jest and Drupal, as well
            as the developer fundamentals like Git and GitHub.
            <br />
            I even got to work with exciting new technologies; Robotic Process
            Automation tools like UiPath and n8n, as well as low-code solutions
            such as Microsoft Power Platform.

          <p class="item-description">
            My time at The Electric Car Scheme, despite being quite short, was
            very helpful to my career.
            <br />
            For one thing it taught me that I'm probably not a natural
            salesperson and I would find more enjoyment in a career path better
            suited to me and my talents.
            <br />
            It was while working as a Business Development Executive at ECS that
            I decided to pursue a career in software development, which is
            something I'd always considered.
            <br />
            Sometimes it takes working a job that you don't enjoy to push you in
            the right direction. I will always be thankful for everyone at ECS
            for helping me discover my true passion and career path.

          <p>November 2019 - April 2022</p>
          <img src="./images/bulb.jpg" id="invdev" width="150px" />
          <p class="item-description">
            I consider my time working at Bulb to be the most important period
            in my life for career, as well as personal growth.
            <br />
            Joining as an Energy Specialist and being tasked with speaking to up
            to 60 customers a day via phones, email and online chat really
            helped me grow in confidence and responsibility.
            <br />
            Spending time in the Social and Community team, conversing with
            customers via social media channels and managing the company app
            store accounts gave me a different perspective on B2C communications
            .
            <br />
            I also gained so much from my time as acting team leader, having to
            be responsible for a team of people and making sure to give them
            what they needed to help them grow professionally.
